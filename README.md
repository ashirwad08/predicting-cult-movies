# Can Pre-Release Information Predict Movie Cult Status  

Started out as a classification problem, but want to treat it as a Linear Regression problem.  
+ Step 1: Create a "Cult Index" that's calculated from post-release information,  
    ++ Movie's Cult score is *rewarded* for high lifetime gross revenue, and *penalized* for high opening weekend and for high number of theaters released in.  (still figuring out an ideal index).  
    ++ To-do! Remove outliers  
    ++ To-do! Adjust lifetime revenue for inflation!! (haven't done this yet)  
    ++ To-do! Id more cult movies! Online lists are very subjective and insufficient.  

## A Note on the Subjective Nature of Cult Status  

As you may guess, there is a lot of debate around what passes for a cult movie. Per the literature, there are two broad categories that these can be split in:  

> **Inclusive** definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while **exclusive** definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirrorclassificatory disputes about art.
